application.js “glue”

Questions I had to ask myself: 
  How to break up the code into manageable chunks. 
  How to store data between sessions. Ideally for scale: database. I chose session storage.
  Make Lists a single view, or a collection of views. Chose collection for ease of modification of the model since cards will be edited frequently and the full collection shouldn't be rerendered with edit of a single card.
  Need to be able to filter cards. That means the board should have access to all of the cards within its lists. To scale to a larger app, would need to reconfigure this to allow for cross-board search. Shouldn't be too difficult to make a user-wide search across all boards.
  Images: Trello uses an icon font; I used a sprite sheet for sake of time.
  How will I do the drag and drop resort logic for both lists and cards?
  Do I want list actions to be its own view? 
  Do I have list view within board view, or created by App?
  Should the side menu activites and comments be updating even when not in view?
